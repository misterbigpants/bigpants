	Greetings you absolute weirdo. My name is Jim McGinley (jim@bigpants.ca) and I played these games 42 years ago.
	Click a game, watch the video, <B>then click a level to play right now</B>!
	A TRS-80 Model III emulated in your browser? Truly it's 2024!
	Unless you're on mobile, in which case you can only read this text and watch the video.
	Most games start boring so I recommend the higher levels.
	I love these games, and now you'll love them - all 16 kilobytes.<BR>
	<BR>
		
	You can reload your game (<B>Ctrl+L</B>) and save (<B>Ctrl+S</B>) - 3 slots per game.
	You can copy a game (<B>Ctrl+C</B>),  paste it into an e-mail (<B>Ctrl+V</B>) and send it to a friend. They can paste it into this site and continue <B>your</B> game!
	Should you reach higher levels or find interesting moments e-mail them to me (jim@bigpants.ca) for main menu consideration.<BR>
	<BR>

	<B>The Hard Sell</B><BR>
	<BR>
	Consider buying <A HRef="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299860/Endlight/" Target="NewEndlight">Endlight</A>, our chaotic action game with a TRS-80 heart. Boom.<BR>

	<DIV Class="jimsection"> <B>RESOLUTION</B></DIV>
	<DIV Style="display:none;color:#CCCCCC;">
		<B>128 x 48</B><BR>
		But it's <B>not</B> that simple.<BR>
		It's <B>actually</B> <A HRef="http://www.trs-80.org/high-resolution-graphics-for-the-trs-80/" Target="Main512">512 x 192</A> (unmatched for a decade).<BR>
		But it's <B>not</B> that simple.<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The display is actually a <B>64x16 grid of 8x12 ASCII characters</B>.
		So the resolution <B>is</B> 512 x 192 <B>but</B> you can't change pixels, <B>only</B> ASCII characters.
		There are 256 ASCII characters to choose from including letters, numbers, symbols, emoticons(!) and <A HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_character_set" Target="MainSquot">squots</A>.
		To provide line spacing between the 16 rows of text, most characters use only 8 of the 12 vertical pixels.
		Presenting... <B>all of them</B>.<BR>
		<BR>

		<A HRef="http://48k.ca/320char.html" Target="MainCharacterSet"><IMG Src="images/main-characterset.png" Style="width:100%;"></A><BR>
		<BR>

		These high resolution characters could only be displayed by the proprietary monitor.
		The result was small, detailed text - something not possible on the Atari 2600, NES or even the mighty Commodore 64.
		Dense text adventures found heaven on the TRS-80, and hell on consoles (the lack of keyboard also didn't help).<BR>
		<BR>

		The entire screen <B>only takes 1Kb</B> of our precious 16Kb: 64 x 16 x 1 byte (256 character possibilities) = 1,024 bytes.
		For comparison, a typical 1080p display takes <A HRef="https://superuser.com/questions/256932/how-do-i-calculate-video-ram-requirements" Target="Main8100">8,100Kb</A>: 1920 x 1080 x 4 bytes (32-bit colour) = 8,294,400 bytes.
		That's 507 TRS-80s.<BR>
		<BR>

		<B>The 128 x 48 Trick</B><BR>
		While it's possible to make a game using 64 x 16 characters, movement would be <B>very</B> choppy.
		i.e. Moving player right would skip 8 pixels at a time.
		i.e. Moving player up would skip 12 pixels at a time.
		Additionally, 64 x 16 provides few places to move.<BR>
		<BR>
		
		To solve this, <A HRef="https://www.trs-80.com/wordpress/tips/graphics/" Target="Main64">64</A> of those ASCII characters represent pixels
		- a genius idea that confused so many for so long (aka. me until now).
		Characters 128 to 191 are <A HREf="https://www.trs-80.com/wordpress/tips/graphics/" Target="Everyvariation">every variation</A> a 2x3 grid of squares can be: from full to empty
		(each square is 4 x 4 pixels).
		So moving a TRS-80 pixel down 6 times means <B>changing</B> the ASCII character at a 64x16 position 3 times,
		then changing the ASCII character below that 3 times.
		Games use this trick all the time resulting in smoother movement (4px), more places to move,
		and the 128 x 48 resolution myth.
		In the immortal words of John Candy: "Those aren't pixels!"<BR>
		<BR>
		
		The drawback? The 2x3 squares are large (4x4 pixels),
		and calculating the correct 2x3 ASCII character for the 64x16 position consumes scarce CPU.
		There wasn't enough memory to handle a 8x12 pixel grid, so this was a brilliant albeit blocky compromise.
		Bonus: Now you understand why a TRS-80 "pixel" <B>can't overlap</B> a letter. A TRS-80 pixel <B>is</B> a letter.<BR>
		<BR>

		<A HREf="https://www.trs-80.com/wordpress/tips/graphics/" Target="MainEveryVariation"><IMG Src="images/main-characterset-graphics.png" Style="width:100%;"></A><BR>
		<BR>

		<B>The Final Result</B><BR>
		For action, games use 4x4 blocky pixels that can be positioned at 128x48.
		For lettering and HUD components, games use 8x12 high-rez characters that can <B>only</B> be positioned at 64x16.					
		The best games mixed these for maximum screen usage.
		i.e. The Dancing Demon blocky pixel curtain was decorated with high-rez letters.
		Combined with the "tall" pixels and screen lines (the emulator captures these perfectly),
		the TRS-80 has a never-imitated, never-duplicated look.<BR>
		<BR>
		
		Can you upgrade the TRS-80 graphics card?<BR>

		The Tandy Radio Shack Z-80 (TRS-80) Model I was released by Radio Shack in <A HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80" Target="MainHardwareWiki">August 3, 1977</A>.
		One of the first computers people could buy for their home from the local mall.
		<B>Hugely successful</B> (greatly outselling Apple until 1982), yet mostly forgotten.<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<B>Technical Specifications</B><BR>
		. Monitor: 12" 15kHz 384x192 monochrome monitor, black & white (no grays)<BR>
		. Processor: Zilog Z-80 1.77 MHz<BR>
		. Memory: 4Kb<BR>
		. Upper case only (<A HRef="https://www.trs-80.com/wordpress/interviews/interview-with-don-french/" Target="MainHardwarePerComputer">saved $1.97 per computer</A>)<BR>
		. Caused radio interference, angering the FCC<BR>
		<BR>
		
		In 1979 the radically different business focussed TRS-80 Model II was released.
		It was not compatible whatsoever, and I know little about this bastard child.<BR>
		<BR>
		
		In 1980 Radio Shack released the <A HRef="http://www.trs-80.org/model-3/" Target="MainHardwareModel3">TRS-80 Model III</A>,
		an improved version of the Model I with a better processor (2.03Mhz), better resolution (512 x 192), more memory (16Kb),
		lower case, and no radio interference.
		Like upgrading from PS4 to PS4 Pro.
		My Dad bought this when I was in Grade 6 because he knew the revolution had come, and he's a genius.
		Games played best on the TRS-80 Model III, so that's what we're emulating.<BR>

	The TRS-80's answer to <A HRef="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotron:_2084" Target="NewRobotron">Robotron</A> (the greatest game ever made).
	A perfect marriage of theme and gameplay, which is a rare thing indeed.
	There's nothing you can do to make Outhouse better.
	The limitations of the TRS-80 work in the games favour, rather than against it.
	Outhouse must be played with a keyboard. i.e. switching directions with a joystick/thumbstick would be problematic at higher levels.<BR>
	<BR>
	
	In the video I attempt to beat Level 18 <B>without</B> smart bombs (the refuge of the weak).

	Despite the gap (and thanks to modern save & reload) I managed to reach 56,000+ points which showcases this unique classic at its absolute best. Accept no substitutes.
	Defense Command was one of the later games created by legendary TRS-80 game developer Big Five Software.
	Every Big Five Software game has a signature eyeball enemy - look for it.		
	Today we'd call Defense Command a 2nd or 3rd generation game, where the developers finally understood the hardware inside and out, and could use every trick in the book.<BR>
	<BR>
	
	As far as I know, Defense Command's unique design (the bastard child of framerate smoothies Defender and Galaxian) has been completely forgotten.
	Additionally, the standard Space Invaders performance trick of allowing the player only one bullet in the air at a time has been elevated here - likely unintentionaly.
	If you can align multiple enemies above you, you can essentialy fire <B>many single shots in a row</B> instantly destroying a fleet.
	This feels incredible and is essential at higher levels.<BR>

	Watch me paint the entire screen white, fulfilling a primal desire I still can't suppress. I finish multiple levels and showcase the criminally overlooked bonus stages.
	I also try to beat Level 9 which is impossible. An action game without shooting did NOT exist in 1982, and I don't believe this design has ever been copied.
	Hopefully casinos (and mobile game devs) don't watch this video.<BR>
	<BR><BR>

	<B>Spacebar Strategy Clarification</B><BR>
	<BR>
	When you hit spacebar, the code checks whether the entire screen is filled.
	Code loops from top left to bottom right exiting when it finds a black pixel. This is typically fast.
	However, if you paint from top left to bottom right, it takes longer and longer to reach a black pixel, so holding spacebar now slows the game down.
	If you remake Crazy Painter, make this official!<BR>

	Scarfman is a fast, chunky, 5 ghost Pac Man clone.
	The power pellets initially last forever, which is heaven.
	Eating a dot plays a sound which slightly pauses the game so you FEEL every bite.
	Against all odds, they built a better beast.
	The Atari 2600 Pac Man released a year later and sold millions. I never recovered.<BR>
	<BR>
				
	Thanks to many reloads, I reached fabled Skill Level 9. The monsters are much smarter, and the power pellets don't last long.
	At this point you're using power pellets exclusively to eat dots (avoid eating monsters, they intefere too quickly).
	Scarfman does not appear to go beyond Skill Level 9, which might be a good thing.
	I no longer hear the munching sound.<BR>

	Right arrow shoots AND moves player right - a bizarre scheme that somehow works, and has never been seen again.
	Worth noting that shooting is unreliable, unsure if that's exasperated by the emulator.
	The 3D rotation animation of the enemy radar stations remains immaculate.
	You can also edit the landscapes (did someone say modding)!<BR>
	<BR>
	
	To save memory (they had 16KB total to work with), the detailed landscape is stored as 2 values (top and bottom) for each x co-ordinate.
	Height differences are connected when rendered.
	A genius approach, and perhaps the first game to use heightmaps.

	Dancing Demon was the first game my Dad bought us for the TRS-80.
	The games were all hanging on a wall in Radio Shack, and that cover art really caught me and my brothers attention
	(that's all you had to go on).
	Playing Space Invaders and Asteroids at the arcade did not prepare me for a full screen animated cartoon.
	There was nothing like it at the time, and there's still nothing like it.
	It remains absolutely mind blowing.
	Games do not look, sound or play like this.
	Easily the TRS-80's most iconic game. Our Mario, or perhaps Crash.<BR>
	<BR>

	Players create a show by inputting song notes and accompanying dance steps.
	Players then watch the show. The song plays while an incredibly well animated demon tap dances.
	Creating shows is a lengthy, arduous process but the results are worth it.
	Video showcases 2 shows I made: Coldplay's "Fix You", and RadioHead's "Let Down".
	Taking ~3 hours each, they are my greatest achivements in life.
	Video also shows <B>you</B> how to make a show (and how to use a modern text editor to help).<BR>

			"And then came Dancing Demon. The first version of that program used string packing. But it just wasn't satisfactory. ..it wouldn't run fast enough for one thing.
			The second and final versions of Demon used line packing for almost all of its operation. There is a very small amount of string packing used.
			This change in techniques made a whale of a difference! Duel-N-Droids and Fire Bird both use line packing and very little actual Basic programming."<BR>
			<BR>

			"What is Line Packing? Line Packing is a programming technique which allows machine language subroutines and related data to be stored and used from within a Basic program. The line numbers used in Basic serve to separate one routine from another and from the actual Basic part of the program. Subroutines are entered by typing in a dummy Basic line containing the number of bytes necessary to hold the subroutine. Then the line is packed or loaded with the actual codes for the subroutine. A special "Line Finder" subroutine is used to find the start of such a packed line. This allows the subroutine to be called^ from Basic or from another machine language subroutine. The Line Finder also finds the start of a line of data when needed by a subroutine.
			This programming technique has quite a number of advantages. It also has a few limitations."<BR>

			In the June 1996 issue of Next Generation magazine, famed game designer Chris Crawford dismissed Leo as "guy who graphically updated Nim".
			"He designed one or two more games, but they were straightforward repeats of Android Nim. People lost interest in his cute little animated games. I never heard anything more of Leo Christopherson."
			Worth noting this was pre-Internet, proving that the Internet might indeed be... good?<BR>

	<BR>

	The TRS-80 SimCity (at least as close as we get).
	A buy & sell style game that moves <B>very quickly</B> thanks to tragically efficient keyboard commands.
	Feed your people, build your army, and attack opponents trying to do the same thing.
	Thanks to modern technology, you can now play at <B>5X THE SPEED</B>,
	sparing you the pain of waiting for 5 computer player turns.
	Empire plays better in 2024 than it did in 1981!<BR>
	<BR>
	
	Attacks play out in real time - something that <B>never</B> happens in text based games.
	They stand in brilliant contrast to the rest of the game.
	Attacks are incredibly basic: Just 2 numbers counting down.
	Pray your number counts down <I>slower</I>. Seriously, it's harrowing.
	Even in 2024, this abstraction remains insanely compelling.
	Peter uncovered something casinos (and mobile game devs) must never discover.<BR>
	<BR>

	As awful as it sounds, <A HREf='javascript:LoadScript1(null, "EMPIRE", 9, true);'>slaughtering serfs</A> (after destroying their army)
	is the main reason to play Empire.
	When your army fights their army, it's two small numbers counting down quickly.
	You acclimatize to this.
	When your army finally fights their serfs, your <B>small</B> number counts down <B>slowly</B> while their <B>large</B> number counts down <B>quickly</B>.
	Contrasted with the previous army fights, you feel very powerful.
	Plus, don't your hard working army guys deserve a break?
	Extra rewards are given for killing lots of serfs.
	So bad, yet so good.<BR>
	<BR>

	The tremendous satisfaction of breaking through your opponent's army,
	then slaughtering their helpless serfs, has never been rivalled.
	The absolute agony when this <A HRef="https://youtu.be/BHDISwvf6uw?t=5698" Target="EmpireAgony">happens to you</A> has also never been rivalled.
	I've never felt so helpless.
	Being able to reload/restart soothes this pain... somewhat.
	I would avoid multiplayer where that's not possible.
	Watching your friend put on a brave face as their number ticks down,
	time slowing to a crawl while all oxygen leaves the room, is an ... experience.<BR>
	<BR><BR>

	<B>After The Fall</B><BR>
	<BR>
	Consider buying <A HRef="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299860/Endlight/" Target="NewEndlight">Endlight</A>, our chaotic action game nothing like Empire but everything your TRS-80 heart desires.
	I'll never <B>ask</B> you to choose between Empire and Endlight, I'll <B>tell</B> you to choose <A HRef="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299860/Endlight/" Target="NewEndlight">Endlight</A>. Boom.<BR>

			<LI>
				Make sure you play <B>5X THE SPEED</B>!
				Spares you the pain of waiting for 5 computer player turns.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			
			<LI>
				<B>Empire is all about the wheat.</B>
				If you fail to feed your people enough, you risk getting assassinated.
				Money is worth less than wheat. Fighting and gaining land is secondary to wheat.
				Should you choose to sell wheat, always ask yourself "Will doing this kill me?"
				The answer is always yes.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			
			<LI>
				Serfs are the most precious commodity in the game.
				You need them to increase the size of your army, but their numbers increase slowly and they're killed easily.
				Always feed them extra so the births counteract the deaths by disease.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
				
			<LI>
				After you feed your army and people, you <B>must</B> have 10,000+ wheat for next year's harvest.
				If you've used all wheat, <B>next year</B> you'll have 0 wheat even with great weather.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
									
			<LI>
				<B>Try to attack the same person twice.</B> The first destroys their army,
				and the second slaughters serfs en masse. If you kill enough serfs,
				you deal extra damage and receive this ultra disturbing report<BR>
				<BR>
				<IMG Src="game-EMPIREImage3.GIF" Style="width:100%;height:auto;"><BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>

			<LI>
				Always leave some army for defense. Even a single army man can protect your serfs from an enemy attack.
				Remember: It's extremely hard to replenish dead serfs.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			
			<LI>
				<B>The advantage of going first</B><BR>
				At the end of a full round, Empire shows you everyone's stats including how much army they have.
				Since you go first <I>(before others have a chance to replenish their armies)</I>
				you know how much army they'll have when you attack! Get those serfs!<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			
			<LI>
				<B>The drawback of going first</B><BR>
				Oppenents can attack you even <B>after</B> you destroy their army.
				Their <B>full</B> turn comes after you're done attacking,
				where they'll buy a full army again (just like you).
				You can mitigate this by killing their serfs and stealing lots of land, which reduces their max army size.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			
			<LI>
				If you're attacking serfs, they will defeat you - so <B>never</B> send your <B>entire</B> army to attack serfs.
				Additionally, you'll <B>only</B> deal extra damage if there's <B>an army man</B> left to collect.
				Nothing is more disheartening than killing hundreds of innocent people, and only winning acres of land.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
									
			<LI>
				The maximum size of your army is determined by how much palace you've bought (which attracts nobles),
				<B>how many serfs you have</B>, and how much land you have.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			
			<LI>While fighting, to see how many troops you have attack with a ridiculous amount (I always use 500).
				The game will ignore the attack and reply "You only have X troops."
				Ta-da! You have outsmarted the system.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>

			<LI>
				At any point, you can have a <A HRef="javascript:LoadVideo('EMPIRE', false,  29 * 60 + 13);">heart attack and die</A>.
				There's nothing that I know of that can prevent this.
				Remember to Copy (Ctrl+C) or Save (Ctrl+S) your game before this happens (modern tech to the rescue!).
				The good news is heart attacks happen to computer opponents!<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			
			<LI><B>* Spoiler *</B> You'll eventually get all the land <B>including</B> all the barbarian land <B>yet</B> the game continues.
				You'll eventually get 100% palace and the game continues.
				The game suddenly ended at year 40 and finally declared me emperor, a feat never achieved until 2024.
				Experience that <A HRef='javascript:LoadScript1(null, "EMPIRE", 8, true);'>yourself</A><BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>

			<LI><B>* Spoiler *</B> When just the barbarians are left, don't completely defeat them.
				Use them to reduce your army to 0, then ignore them.
				That way you have no army to feed saving some grain.<BR>

				Empire shipped on cassette with <A HREf="https://archive.org/details/cload_newsletter" Target="EmpireCloud">CLOAD Magazine</A> (Feb 1981).

		<I>(originally provided as a <A HREF='javascript:LoadScript1(null, "EMPIRE", 4, true);'>separate basic program</A>, copied here for your convenience)</I><BR>
		<B>Hello! Welcome to  E M P I R E ...</B><BR>
		<BR>

		Imagine yourself to be the ruler of a small, unimportant piece
		of European land way back in the medieval ages. Your country is
		beset by many problems - no industry, little trade, small army,
		underpopulation, angry neighbors, plague, and all the other
		day-to-day problems a capable leader must learn to face.
		Ambitious by necessity, you must aquire land, capital, and an
		army just to survive. Because of the short lifetimes back then,
		you'll have only a limited amount of time to build your country into an empire.<BR>
		<BR>
																		
		Competent rule will gradually be rewarded with lofty titles:
		Knight, Prince, King, and finally <B>Emperor</B><BR>
		<BR>

		<B>Sounds easy?</B><BR>
		Then consider this - five other city-states are 
		also struggling to become the emperor, and they don't just intend
		to passively watch you win. They control armies which can
		attack at a moments notice, and perhaps devastate your country.
		They control the grain market, and if you think OPEC is bad,
		just wait and see how scarce and expensive grain can become.<BR>
		<BR>

		Of course, a competent ruler could make a killing on the grain market.
		With proper planning, your harvests should be plentiful.
		You could solve overpopulation problems by raising a 
		large army to be killed off in battle.<BR>
		<BR>

		Nevertheless, your overiding concern should be lebensraum - living room.
		There is only a limited amount of land to be conquered.
		If you can defeat the barbarian hordes, and the well trained standing armies of the other nations,
		and then defeat   their peasant militias, perhaps you may attain the well deserved title of Emperor.<BR>
		<BR>

		<B>Taxes</B><BR>
		The customs tax applies only to immigrants to your nation.
		Often, lower customs tax means more immigrants.
		The sales tax is closely intertwined into your capitalist economy.
		While it has the potential of raising lots of money,
		overly high taxes tend to stifle industrial profits.
		Income taxes are paid by all inhabitants and industry.
		Again, lower income tax often means increased industrial output.<BR>
		<BR>

		You have the option each year to invest your earnings in
		different types of trade and industry. In the years to follow,
		these investments, if managed correctly, will more than pay for themselves.<BR>
		<BR>

		<B>Types of investments</B><BR>
		<UL>
			<LI><B>Marketplaces</B> are a relatively cheap investment that are quite
			profitable because they encourage the formation of a middle class - the merchants.
			And, as you are probably aware, the middle class pays an inordinate share of taxes.<BR><BR></LI>

			<LI><B>Grain Mills</B> are necessary to process the harvest, and consequently,
			usually do quite well when there is a large harvest.<BR><BR></LI>

			<LI><B>Foundries</B> are necessary for the creation of large armies.     
			Several of them will allow you to equip a much larger army      
			than otherwise.<BR><BR></LI>

			<LI><B>Shipyards</B> have the greatest profit potential of all investments.
			Because of a larger volume of orders during good weather,
			there is often a better return during these years.<BR><BR></LI>

			<LI><B>Armies</B> are never a profitable investment. Besides costing     
			a large initial investment, they also cost a lot to maintain    
			and train. In addition, they also require a greater fraction    
			of the harvest than serfs.<BR><BR></LI>

			<LI>Of course, one should give himself the luxury of building a   
			<B>Palace</B>. What else could distinguish an emperor from all the     
			other kings with their castles, than a palace? Also, with a     
			palace, your country will begin to attract more nobles.<BR><BR></LI>
		</UL>

		<B>Other general hints:</B><BR>
		You always lose 10% as a brokerage fee when dealing on the    
		grain market. When you sell your grain at different prices,     
		the market price is the weighted average of the sales prices    
		(this helps to prevent large yearly price fluctuations). To     
		prevent those unscrupulous rulers who try to use the market as  
		a method to avoid the rats, you can't buy back your own grain.<BR>
		<BR>

		Also, leave a portion of your grain reserve for planting for    
		next year's harvest. Often, it is beneficial to feed your people much more than they 
		require. Immigrants are usually attracted to a prosperous nation,
		and sometimes, even merchants and nobles move in.<BR>
		<BR>
																																	
		Up to six people can play this game. Rulers not played by     
		humans will be played by your TRS-80, with its playing ability
		based on the average of the human players.<BR>
		<BR>

		<B>Winning</B><BR>                                                        
		<UL>
			<LI>To become a <B>Prince</B>, you must pass these rather stringent        
			qualifications:8 marketplaces, 4 mills, palace 20% completed,   
			a land-over-serf ratio of 4.8, over 10 nobles, and over 2300    
			serfs.<BR><BR></LI>

			<LI>To become a <B>King</B>, you must have:14 marketplaces, 6 mills,       
			palace 60% completed, 1 foundry, land-over-serf ratio of at     
			least 5.0, Over 2600 serfs and 25 nobles.<BR><BR></LI>

			<LI>To become an <A HRef='javascript:LoadScript1(null, "EMPIRE", 8, true);'><B>EMPEROR</B></A> you must meet all of the above qualifications,
			and over 3100 serfs and 40 nobles.<BR><BR></LI>

			<LI><I>Editor's Note: No mention how one becomes the aforementioned Knight</I><BR><BR></LI>
		</UL>

		Position the tape and type 'CLOAD' when you are ready.<BR>
		<B>Good luck, future rulers!</B><BR>

	As close as we got to Zelda (which released 3 years later).

	Rather than beating levels, you're travelling a connected world.

Mad Max on the meaning of games

I got pretty excited when 80 Micro asked me to write Proof Notes, since Rodney and Mercedes hog the Gamer's Cafe.
Then I found out that it was for the games issue. Hey - I know something about serious stuff, too.
I even won a prize in high school for my paper, "The Cicada — Nature's Little Time Capsule."

Of course, games can be pretty serious business. Who among us has not felt the massive wave of depression that comes from missing a scoreboard by 10 points, the blind rage from a sneak attack by some sleazy little alien with no sense of morals or even etiquette?
	And what about when you shoot a ship swooping down on you and it doesn't diet AND WHAT ABOUT WHEN THE MACHINE LOCKS UP JUST AS—
Well. Suffice it to say that games are not all fun and games.

But let's get philosophical for a moment. What's so great about TRS-80 games anyway? I mean, why would anyone want to play some stupid space shoot-em-up on a dinky black-andwhite monitor with lousy graphics to boot when he could be cruising along on a sleek new Apple He or Atari 800?
Yes, I wondered that myself once, when all my friends sneered at me and I only dared to play Galaxy Invasion in the bathroom after 3 a.m.
But no more! I'm proud to be a TRS-80 gamer!! AND I'LL TAKE ON ANY MAN WHO—
But no point in getting worked up here. I've made peace with my games.
No longer am I ashamed of them.
For in TRS-80 games I have found simplicity, and in that simplicity I have found the essence of computer gaming.

Who needs all those splashy colors? What's so great about realistic highresolution graphics?
Why bother with state-of-the-art voice synthesis?
These are but frilly trappings that obfuscate the basic (some might even say primordial) confrontation between man and machine.

No matter what we call those objects on the screen, no matter what planet we're on or mythical foe we're fighting,
are we doing anything more than trying to zap a bunch of phosphor blobs the computer is tossing at us? Isn't that what it's really all about?

The TRS-80 gamer is a minimalist and a purist. He lets his imagination fill the blanks between the few broad strokes the computer paints with its luminescent brush.
And in doing so, he becomes one with the game; in fact, he becomes the game, another ball on a binary billiard table that sits in an ephemeral pool hall on an ephemeral side street somewhere in a city that lies next to a river of dreams on a vibrational plane that cuts sharply through a region of time known only to —

Hmmm. I've probably said enough (Mercedes thinks I've said enough when I say "Good morning").
Except to add that the games in this issue have been given the Gamer's Cafe Seal of Approval, and we highly recommend them to you.
(And not simply because the editors at 80 Micro have threatened to ax the Cafe if we don't.) Just remember the words of John Godfrey Saxe:

In battle or business, whatever the game,
In law or in love, it is ever the same;
In the struggle for power, or the scramble for pelf,
Let this be your motto — Rely on yourself!
For, whether the prize be a ribbon or throne,
The victor is he who can go it alone!
Whatever pelf is.
— Mad Max

	<li><B>Tips</B><BR>Explosions can destory other ships. Meaning it's possible to shoot 40 bullets and destroy 50 ships.
		You don't get more points for this, but it feels awesome.
		The super saucer looks like a walking pair of pants, and appears once near the end of regular time,
		and once near the end of extra time.
		The skull is effectively wearing a helmet,
		and must be hit in the mouth (a nice tactile touch!).
		The penalty for missing a shot or letting an alien escape is very small, so go nutzo.

	<li><B>Investigate</B><BR>
		Time decreases the same rate whether you're playing Hard (fast) or Easy (slow).
		This should mean Hard sends more ships, leading to higher scores.
		So far that does not appear to be the case and I don't understand why.
		Additionally, if enemy explosions kill other enemies you appear to get credit,
		unless the enemies run into the explosion. Meaning you should kill ships in danger of running into explosions first,
		rather than relying on explosions to destory them.

	A third generation TRS-80 game, the hardware is absolutely maxed out.
	Those bouncing donut animations remain sweet.
	Donut Dilemma released in Australia at the end of the TRS-80 life cycle,
	resulting in poor sales and a lost classic. In 1984 this would have blown my mind... it <B>still</B> blows my mind!<BR>

		"Angry Angelo has raided Antonio's
		Donut Factory sending the entire complex amuck!
		Donuts have come alive - and are jumping around in wild frenzies.
		Machines have gone out of control throwing cooking fat, dough and icing sugar everywhere.
		You must help poor Antonio climb ladders, jump platforms and ride elevators to reach the top floor
		and shut down the factory's power generator which will restore law and order. But hurry for time is running out!<BR>
		<BR>
		DONUT DILEMMA features nine different screens of crazy factory floor space!
		The graphics are flicker free, smooth pixel motion and just have to be seen!
		Complex sound effects accompanied with background music makes this game one Iof the best ever designed for the TRS-80.<BR>
